## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider

### Limitations

It was necessary to use some properties that are just supported by Chrome-Browser. So please use Chrome to check out my results. Thank you!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- A11Y Slider - Library
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In relation to JS I've learned that the order of the ressources are very important. I tried to initialize a library (A11ySlider) in a local JS-file (index.js). Into my script i've put my local file before the library and it didn't worked. After a friend of mine gave me the hint I recognized that the order of the ressources are very important. This time I recognized some progression in my understandment for Grid and specially the benefits of grid-area.
